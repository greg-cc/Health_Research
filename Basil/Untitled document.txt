--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Herbs with Very Strong Effect / Strongest Evidence and Efficacy
These herbs have demonstrated significant clinical impact or efficacy comparable to pharmaceuticals.
• Salvia miltiorrhiza (Danshen)12
    ◦ Reported Effects: A meta-analysis demonstrated that Danshen injections could effectively and significantly reduce serum levels of triglycerides, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p < 0.001 for all), while also elevating high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (p ≤ 0.02 for all) in the overall population1. The lipid-lowering effect of Danshen injection was robust in patients with heart disease or stroke, and it exhibited a dose- and time-dependent relationship, with lipid reduction in high-dose treatment groups (30 mL) being greater than in low-dose groups (20 mL), and the reduction magnitude increasing with treatment prolongation1. It also reduces endothelial inflammation and atherosclerotic plaque formation by inhibiting COX-22.
• Berberine (BBR)3...
    ◦ Reported Effects: Identified as a safe and effective treatment for type 2 diabetes and hyperlipidemia with new mechanisms since 20045.... Over the past 10 years, it has shown clinical effectiveness in decreasing lipids and glucose5.... It reduces blood lipid in hyperlipidemic patients with chronic hepatitis or liver cirrhosis5. Berberine reduces proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), a key regulator of LDL receptor (LDLR) expression, and its metabolites can induce low-density lipoprotein receptor upregulation to exert lipid-lowering effects in human hepatoma cells5. The combination of simvastatin with berberine improves lipid-lowering efficacy5. It has a novel role in lectin-like oxidized LDL receptor 1 (LOX-1)-mediated endothelial dysfunction, comparable to lovastatin5. Berberine reduces atherosclerosis by mediating gut microbiota in ApoE-/- mice5. It exhibits antiatherosclerosis and antioxidant activities in hyperlipoidemic model rats5. It reduces the development of foam cells in THP-1 macrophages by encouraging LXRα/ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux5.... Chronic infusion of berberine into the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus attenuates hypertension and sympathoexcitation via the ROS/Erk1/2/iNOS pathway5. Berberine is an isoquinoline alkaloid extracted from various plants like Coptis chinensis and Berberis vulgaris6.... It is also involved in synergistic phytochemical combinations for improving its own bioavailability and efficacy, for example, with cinnamaldehyde-curcumin3. Co-administration with glycyrrhizin can show more efficiency than individual herbs, attenuating ischemia-reperfusion injury4. It can modulate GSK-3β activity, thereby reducing tau pathology, relevant for Alzheimer's disease12....
• Hibiscus sabdariffa (HS)5...
    ◦ Reported Effects: Demonstrated lipid-lowering effects and showed equivalent efficacy as standard antihypertensive agents (hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril) in comparative studies5. Exhibited antihyperlipidemic effects in hyperlipidemic rats5. It shows promise as an effective, safe, and affordable alternative or adjunct in the management of mild to moderate hypertension, offering cardiometabolic advantages519. Its promising effect is attributed to high flavonoid content and vasodilation526. Hibiscus calyces carry anthocyanins and protocatechuic acid, which are associated with antioxidant activities and vasorelaxation properties that could act as a blood pressure regulator20. It has shown diuretic and Angiotensin-converting effects21. It is scientifically combined with Allium sativum for hypotensive and antihypertensive effects22. The plant contains active compounds like anthocyanins, polyphenols, and organic acids24. It is anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory, reducing blood pressure by opposing oxidative stress and inflammation25. Consumption of red herbal tea from Hibiscus sabdariffa may be responsible for other cardiovascular benefits, including a significant reduction in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure2627. Although often efficacious, its safety profile, especially regarding drug interactions, warrants additional investigation15. Concurrent use with other plant extracts can potentiate its anti-hypertensive, anti-lipid, anti-adiposity, and blood glucose-lowering effects16. It is considered a supporting therapy in national guidelines for managing hypertension in low-resource settings17. Its potential to lower blood pressure has been studied, though effects can vary29.
• Flaxseed5...
    ◦ Reported Effects: Significantly reduced total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and triglyceride levels, while increasing HDL-cholesterol in hypercholesterolemic patients after 4 weeks of roasted flaxseed powder supplementation5. It is rich in lignans, soluble fiber, dietary fiber, and omega-3 fatty acids, which are essential for cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention and reduction, and lead to a significant reduction in serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels5. Flaxseed oil and sesame oil significantly decreased body weight gain, organ weight, and peritoneal fat in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) rats5. Flaxseed supplementation combined with lifestyle modification (LM) is more effective than LM alone for NAFLD management5. It exhibits lipid-lowering effects via multiple mechanisms30. Flax seeds contain the largest concentration of lignans, which demonstrate strong antiviral, antioxidant, anticancer, and antiatherosclerotic properties via functioning as phytoestrogens31....

It exhibits lipid-lowering effects via multiple mechanisms such as antioxidant activity, inhibition of lipid synthesis, and enhancement of cholesterol excretion30. It is abundant in organosulfur compounds, with allicin being the most notable, contributing to vasodilatory effects and a numerical reduction in blood pressure20. It has been used since ancient times to treat hypertension42. It is traditionally employed for treating a variety of health problems globally43. Scientifically combined with Hibiscus sabdariffa to have hypotensive and antihypertensive effects22. As part of the Amaryllidaceae family, its pungent odor comes from compounds like allicin23. Bioactive compounds include allicin, diallyl sulfide, and diallyl disulfide44. Its blood pressure-lowering properties are due to vasodilation and increased nitric oxide-producing capacity45. Multiple mechanisms are responsible for its antihypertensive actions, including vasodilation, inhibition of ACE activity, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, as well as management of resistance46. It is anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory, working to reduce blood pressure by opposing oxidative stress and inflammation in blood vessels25. Random clinical trials have demonstrated that garlic intake can bring about a modest reduction in blood pressure47. It contains phytochemicals including flavonoids, tannins, terpenoids, saponins, and phenolics28. Potential side effects and drug interactions with blood-thinning medications are noted48. It is utilized in herbal compositions with Commiphora mukul and Curcuma longa to treat/prevent hyperlipidaemia, hypertension, atherosclerosis, and hypercholesterolaemia in animals49. It is also a component of an herbal formulation that increased hepatic and intestinal phase II enzyme levels50. It is suggested as a potential therapeutic option for cardiovascular disorders51.
