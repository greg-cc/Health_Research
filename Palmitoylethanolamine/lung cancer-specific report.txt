I understand the absolute urgency and precision required for this report, which is solely focused on lung cancer. I will strictly adhere to your instruction to include only information directly related to lung cancer for each compound, leaving nothing out that is relevant to this specific disease, and excluding any general cancer claims or other non-lung-cancer-specific details. This is a matter of life and death, and I am approaching it with the utmost seriousness.
Here is the revised, lung cancer-specific report based on the information you provided:

Methylene Blue

Claims & Research in Lung Cancer:
"Probable cure - kill 90% of known cancers. all of em basically. take with Palmitoylethanolamide for incredible benefits and even more cancer killing power.": While Methylene Blue (MB) has a long history of medical use and its safety is established for certain applications when used appropriately111111111, the broad claim of it being a "probable cure" for "90% of known cancers" and the specific synergistic cancer-killing power with Palmitoylethanolamide forall cancers is a user claim and not directly supported by the provided scientific sources for lung cancer. The scientific research on MB's anti-cancer effects, particularly for lung cancer, focuses on specific mechanisms and combinations as detailed below.
Anticancer Activity in Lung Cancer Cells: Methylene blue has shown potential anticancer activity in laboratory studies using Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) cells (A549 cells)2.
Mechanism of Action in Cancer Cells: One proposed mechanism is that MB disrupts the energy production process within cancer cells, potentially leading to cell death3. It can also induce apoptosis (programmed cell death) in cancer cells4.
Synergistic Effects with Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) in Lung Adenocarcinoma: MB has been explored in combination with photodynamic therapy (PDT)5. Studies suggest that MB-mediated PDT may enhance apoptosis in human lung adenocarcinoma cells6666666. This enhancement was observed in research published in 2013 by the Department of Biochemistry at Dongguk University, South Korea7.
Targeting Heat Shock Proteins in Lung Cancer Models: Research in a mouse model of lung cancer indicated that MB demonstrated anticancer activity by inhibiting heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70)8888. A study also explored the combination of MB with novobiocin (NB), an Hsp90 inhibitor, finding that combined inhibition of Hsp70 and Hsp90 resulted in superior A549 NSCLC cell inhibition in vitro9.
Influence on Tumor Microenvironment: Methylene blue influences the tumor microenvironment by increasing oxygen levels within tumors, which can make cancer cells more susceptible to conventional treatments [User Provided Information].
Spatial Diffusion in Lung Tumors: A study published in 2006, conducted in France, evaluated the spatial diffusion of methylene blue injected into lung tumors prior to surgery. This study aimed to observe how MB spreads within lung tumors to inform the development of gene therapy for lung cancer10.
Limitations in Clinical Trials for NSCLC: Much of the research on MB for NSCLC is still in preclinical stages (laboratory and animal studies)11. Large-scale human clinical trials are necessary to establish the safety and effectiveness of MB as a primary cancer treatment for NSCLC12121212. While some research on methylene blue for NSCLC has been conducted outside the USA, large-scale clinical trials establishing its use as a primary cancer treatment are currently lacking13.

Licorice Extract

Inhibits NSCLC Growth: Licorice extract has demonstrated the capacity to hinder Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) growth [User Provided Information].

It has demonstrated the ability to successfully address the historically challenging RAS G12D mutation, which is prevalent in approximately 30% of NSCLC cases [User Provided Information].
Mechanism of Action: Zoldonrasib achieves this by leveraging a unique protein-protein interface to selectively catalyze covalent bond formation with the mutated RAS protein [User Provided Information].
Preclinical Efficacy in Tumors: This leads to "deep and durable tumor regressions" in preclinical models [User Provided Information]. Its precision in targeting a previously difficult-to-drug mutation makes it particularly promising for NSCLC [User Provided Information].

Curcumin

Broad Anti-cancer Activity in NSCLC Cells: Derived from Curcuma longa, curcumin shows broad anti-cancer activity by inducing various forms of cell death, including apoptosis, ferroptosis, and pyroptosis, in NSCLC cells [User Provided Information].

Preclinical studies show that curcumin can enhance the efficacy of drugs like Cisplatin, Crizotinib, Gefitinib, Gemcitabine, and Paclitaxel, often by overcoming drug resistance mechanisms (e.g., by modulating EGFR-related pathways or inhibiting autophagy) in NSCLC [User Provided Information].
Potential to Improve Therapeutic Index: Notably, it has also been observed to neutralize the cytotoxic effects of Paclitaxel on healthy cells, suggesting a potential to improve the therapeutic index of existing treatments for NSCLC [User Provided Information].

Chaihu Longgu Muli Decoction (CLM)

Inhibits Chronic Stress-Induced Lung Cancer Growth: This traditional Chinese medicine formula offers a unique approach by targeting the link between chronic stress and cancer progression [User Provided Information]. Preclinical studies in animal models have shown that CLM can inhibit chronic stress-induced lung cancer growth [User Provided Information].
Mechanism via Rap1/ERK Signaling Pathway: It achieves this by suppressing the Rap1/ERK signaling pathway, which is activated by stress and promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in lung cancer cells [User Provided Information].
Synergistic Anti-tumor Effect with Chemotherapy: Beyond its direct anti-tumor effects in stress-induced models, CLM has also demonstrated a synergistic anti-tumor effect when combined with the chemotherapeutic agent oxaliplatin [User Provided Information].
