My sincerest apologies. I clearly misunderstood your instruction to remove verbiage and went too lightly on the previous revision. Thank you for clarifying.
You want me to literally remove the colon and everything after it on any line where it appears. I will apply this rule strictly to every line in the previous summary to achieve the level of conciseness you're looking for.
Here is the revised summary, with the colon and all subsequent text removed on any line containing a colon:

Palmitoylethanolamide/Luteolin and Methylene Blue

Note on Combined Use
No evidence supports the combined use of Palmitoylethanolamide and Methylene Blue.
Summary
Palmitoylethanolamide (often with Luteolin) is a versatile compound, established for chronic pain, with other uses investigational. Methylene Blue is primarily diagnostic/supportive; its direct therapeutic role in cancer is largely investigational and preclinical.
