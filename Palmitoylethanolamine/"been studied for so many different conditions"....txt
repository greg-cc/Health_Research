Of course. Because Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) interacts with so many different biological systems, it has been investigated for a surprisingly wide range of human conditions beyond the most common applications like general chronic pain or neuropathy.
Based on a review of scholarly studies, here are five tables outlining some of these lesser-known or emerging applications. The tables are organized according to the primary biological mechanism that is most relevant to each condition, with explanations in layman's terms.
Table 1: Conditions Studied via Key Cellular "Switches" (PPAR-α)
This mechanism involves PEA "flipping a switch" inside a cell's nucleus to calm inflammation, protect the cell from damage, and regulate metabolism. It's particularly relevant for chronic conditions involving organ inflammation and metabolic dysfunction.

Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH)
In this severe form of fatty liver disease, PEA is studied for its ability to use the PPAR-α switch to reduce liver inflammation and restore the liver's natural cellular cleanup processes (autophagy).1
A study in a mouse model of NASH showed that micronized PEA protected against the disease by inhibiting inflammation and restoring autophagy.1
Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)
For kidney damage, often linked to diabetes, PEA is explored as a "kidney-friendly" option to reduce the chronic inflammation and tissue scarring (fibrosis) that drive the disease's progression.2
PEA has been shown to reduce early kidney dysfunction and injury in animal models of ischemia.3 It is considered a potential candidate for treating CKD due to its anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic properties.2
Metabolic Syndrome
In postmenopausal women, PEA is being investigated for its potential to help manage metabolic syndrome by activating PPAR-α, which helps regulate the body's use of fats and sugars and controls inflammation.4
Research suggests PEA's activation of PPAR-α makes it a promising supplement for managing metabolic syndrome, potentially addressing mood and cognitive issues associated with menopause as well.4
Atherosclerosis (Hardening of the Arteries)
PEA is studied for its ability to protect against the buildup of plaque in arteries. It encourages the immune cells in the plaque (macrophages) to switch from a pro-inflammatory state to a "clean-up" and resolving state, which can stabilize the plaque and reduce arterial inflammation.6
In animal models, PEA treatment reduced the size of early atherosclerotic plaques and promoted signs of stability in more advanced plaques by reducing inflammation and necrotic core size.7
Table 2: Conditions Studied via the "Entourage Effect"
This mechanism doesn't involve PEA acting directly, but rather boosting the body's own "feel-good" and calming molecules (like anandamide) by preventing their breakdown. This is especially relevant for conditions related to mood, stress, and sleep.

Depression (as Adjunctive Therapy)
PEA is studied as an add-on to standard antidepressants. By increasing the brain's natural "bliss molecule" (anandamide), it may help improve mood and relieve depressive symptoms, sometimes more effectively than antidepressants alone.8
A randomized controlled trial showed that PEA added to the antidepressant citalopram led to a significantly greater improvement in depressive symptoms compared to the antidepressant plus a placebo.8
Anxiety Disorders
In conditions of chronic stress (like obesity-induced anxiety), PEA is explored for its ability to calm the system. It helps reduce systemic inflammation and rebalance neurotransmitters in the brain's emotional centers (like the amygdala), leading to reduced anxiety-like behaviors.10
In mouse models of obesity, PEA treatment improved anxiety-like behavior, reduced inflammatory chemicals in the blood, and helped restore balance to neurotransmitters like dopamine and GABA in the brain.10
Sleep Disturbance
PEA is being investigated for its ability to promote better sleep. It is thought to do this by interacting with the body's endocannabinoid system, which helps regulate sleep-wake cycles and promotes a calming effect conducive to rest.12
A double-blind, randomized controlled trial was designed to investigate PEA for sleep disturbance, based on the proposal that it promotes better sleep through its interaction with the endocannabinoid system.12
Schizophrenia (Negative Symptoms)
As an add-on therapy, PEA is being studied to see if it can help with the "negative" symptoms of schizophrenia (like apathy or lack of motivation), which are often difficult to treat with standard medications.13
A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial found that adjuvant PEA therapy with the medication risperidone improved negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia.13
Table 3: Conditions Studied via Key Immune and Nerve Cells
This mechanism focuses on PEA's ability to directly calm overactive immune cells—specifically Mast Cells (the body's "first alarm" cells) and Glial Cells (the brain's immune cells). This is crucial for neuro-inflammatory diseases and allergic-type reactions.

Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD)
In this devastating form of dementia, the brain is under constant attack from neuroinflammation. PEA (often with luteolin) is studied for its ability to calm the brain's overactive immune cells (glia), potentially slowing the progression of cognitive and functional symptoms.14
A Phase 2, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial found that co-ultramicronized PEA with luteolin showed promising efficacy in slowing the decline in disease severity, daily living activities, and language function in FTD patients.14
Multiple Sclerosis (MS)
In MS, the immune system attacks the protective sheath around nerves. PEA is explored for its potential to relieve this inflammation around the nerves by calming the immune cells involved, which may help with symptoms like pain and spasticity.16
Research suggests PEA is a promising supplement for MS symptoms due to its ability to reduce neuroinflammation and support immune health. It has been used in the context of MS for its anti-neuroinflammatory effects.16
Atopic Dermatitis (Eczema)
Eczema involves skin barrier dysfunction and hyper-inflammation, with an elevated number of mast cells in the skin. PEA is studied in topical creams to directly calm these mast cells, reducing redness, dryness, and itchiness.17
A double-blind, randomized clinical trial showed that a topical cream with PEA (Levagen+) significantly reduced eczema symptom severity, including redness and dryness, compared to a standard moisturizer after 4 weeks.17
Allergic Rhinitis
For allergy symptoms, PEA is studied for its ability to directly stabilize mast cells. This prevents them from releasing histamine and other chemicals that cause the classic allergy symptoms of itching, sneezing, and inflammation.19
Research reports that PEA can downregulate mast cell activation, which in turn helps to reduce histamine release and the symptoms associated with allergic rhinitis.19
Table 4: Conditions Studied via Other Cell Surface "Sensors" and Channels
This mechanism involves PEA interacting with other specific sensors on the cell surface, like GPR55 (an endocannabinoid-related receptor) and TRPV1 (a pain and heat sensor), to fine-tune cellular responses.

Interstitial Cystitis / Bladder Pain Syndrome
For this condition of chronic bladder pain, PEA is studied for its ability to calm the hypersensitive nerves in the bladder wall, possibly by modulating pain-sensing channels like TRPV1.20
Clinical use and supporting research for products containing PEA (often with polydatin) have shown a reduction in painful symptoms for patients with interstitial cystitis and bladder pain syndrome.21
Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD)
In dry AMD, there is a buildup of toxic byproducts in the retina. PEA is being explored for its ability to protect retinal cells from dying by interfering with specific stress-signaling pathways (like the ROS-JNK-CHOP pathway) that are triggered by this buildup.22
In-vitro and animal model studies show that PEA protects retinal cells from apoptosis (cell death), improves retinal function, and is a potential therapeutic strategy for dry AMD and the related Stargardt disease.22
Uveitis
This condition involves inflammation inside the eye. PEA has been evaluated for its potential to reduce this inflammation, likely through its broad effects on multiple cellular sensors and pathways involved in ocular inflammatory diseases.24
Uveitis is listed alongside glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy as a pathological state based on chronic inflammation where PEA has been evaluated in clinical trials.24
Ocular Surface Disease / Dry Eye
In some forms of dry eye, the glands in the eyelids get blocked and inflamed (Meibomian Gland Dysfunction). PEA is being explored in eye drops to reduce this inflammation on the surface of the eye, which can improve tear film stability and reduce symptoms of dryness and irritation.25
PEA is used in eye drops (available in Italy) and is being studied for its potential to treat evaporative and toxic dry eye disease, which are often caused by eyelid inflammation and dysfunction.26
Table 5: Conditions Studied via Inflammatory Pathway "Master Controls"
This mechanism highlights PEA's ability to inhibit the "master control" switches of inflammation, like NF-κB, which prevents the cell from launching a full-scale inflammatory attack by producing a flood of cytokines. This is especially relevant in conditions of acute, severe inflammation.

Stroke Recovery
After a stroke, a wave of secondary damage is caused by massive neuroinflammation. PEA (often with luteolin) is studied as an add-on to standard therapy to help resolve this inflammation, reduce neuronal injury, and improve functional and cognitive recovery.27
A randomized, controlled clinical trial in acute ischemic stroke patients found that adding PEA with luteolin to standard therapy for 90 days led to a significant improvement in daily living activities, disability, and cognitive function.27
Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)
Similar to stroke, TBI involves a harmful neuroinflammatory cascade. PEA is studied for its potential to restore normal electrical activity in the brain and reduce neuropsychiatric behaviors (like anxiety or depression) that can follow a TBI by dampening this inflammation.28
A study in a mouse model of mild TBI found that PEA reduces neuropsychiatric behaviors by restoring cortical electrophysiological activity, highlighting its neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory role.28
Endometriosis and Menstrual Pain
Endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory and painful disease. PEA is studied for its ability to cause the regression of endometriotic lesions and reduce pelvic pain by broadly inhibiting the inflammatory process. It is also studied for general menstrual pain, which is driven by inflammatory molecules called prostaglandins.29
Animal models show PEA with polydatin can cause endometriotic lesion regression by reducing inflammation and blood vessel growth.30 A human RCT showed PEA significantly reduces acute menstrual pain compared to a placebo.29
Vulvodynia & Burning Mouth Syndrome
These are chronic, painful conditions with a strong suspected neuroinflammatory component. PEA is studied for its ability to reduce the burning and painful sensations by broadly calming the underlying inflammation and nerve hypersensitivity.31
A preliminary randomized trial concluded that PEA led to a significant decrease in the burning sensation of Burning Mouth Syndrome.32 Case studies and topical formulations have shown PEA can reduce the symptoms of vulvodynia.31
