Report on Investigational Substances for Lung Cancer Treatment
This report synthesizes information on several substances, outlining their preliminary observations, in vitro (human cell) and in vivo (animal cell) trials for lung cancer, and the status of human clinical trials, where available.
Methylene Blue (MB)
• Preliminary Observations: Methylene blue (MB), a phenothiazine compound synthesized in 1876, is being repurposed for oncology due to its capacity to function as a multi-target agent1. Its potential as an anti-cancer agent stems from its ability to intervene in multiple fundamental biological processes dysregulated in malignancy23. Key mechanisms include metabolic disruption, direct apoptosis induction, modulation of the tumor microenvironment through reoxygenation, its role as a sensitizer in photodynamic and sonodynamic therapies, and its capacity to stimulate anti-tumor immunity through immunogenic cell death45.
• Human Cell Trials (in vitro):
    ◦ In the A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cell line, MB-mediated photodynamic therapy (PDT) significantly enhanced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner regarding both MB concentration and light energy6.... The mechanism involved the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the activation of caspases-3 and -86.... A more detailed 2013 study confirmed these findings, associating MB-PDT-induced apoptosis with the downregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins like Bcl-2 and Mcl-1, a reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and ROS generation79.
    ◦ MB also exhibits direct anticancer activity in A549 cells by inhibiting Heat Shock Protein 70 (Hsp70)1011. Combined inhibition of Hsp70 and Hsp90 led to superior A549 Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) cell inhibition in vitro1213.
• Animal Cell Trials (in vivo):
    ◦ In a benzo[a]pyrene-induced lung carcinogenesis mouse model, MB treatment successfully inhibited Hsp70, reduced tumor biomarkers, and improved lung histopathology1114.
    ◦ In a separate study using NCI-H460 xenografts, intratumoral injection of MB followed by PDT resulted in a 52% mean tumor volume regression1415.
    ◦ A 2024 study on Lewis lung carcinoma in mice demonstrated that an intravenous dose of 10 mg/kg MB resulted in a relative increase in tumor oxygenation 120 minutes after administration, suggesting its ability to reoxygenate tumors1617.
• Clinical Trials (Human): Research on MB for NSCLC is primarily preclinical12.... Human clinical trials establishing MB as a primary cancer treatment for NSCLC are currently lacking12.... One human study involving NSCLC patients evaluated the spatial diffusion of MB after bronchoscopic injection into tumors, but its purpose was to assess the feasibility of delivering gene therapy constructs, not to treat the cancer with MB itself14.... Large-scale human clinical trials are necessary to establish its safety and effectiveness1220.
Licorice Extract
• Preliminary Observations: Not explicitly mentioned in the provided text.
• Human Cell Trials (in vitro): Licorice extract has demonstrated the capacity to hinder NSCLC growth26. It achieves this by downregulating the CDK4-Cyclin complex, effectively blocking cell progression from the G0 to G1 phase in tumor cells26. It has also been observed to elevate PD-L1 protein abundance, which augments antigen presentation and fosters CD8+ T cell infiltration, suggesting an immunomodulatory effect relevant to NSCLC26.
• Animal Cell Trials (in vivo): Not mentioned in the provided text.
• Clinical Trials (Human): Not mentioned in the provided text.
Zoldonrasib

Isn't pea rather short lived and ineffective unless taken with mb?
Based on the sources and our conversation history, here's an explanation regarding Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) and Methylene Blue (MB):
Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) and its Duration/Effectiveness
You are correct that Phenylethylamine (PEA) on its own is rather short-lived1.
• PEA's Half-Life: Phenylethylamine (PEA) has a very short half-life, estimated to be only about 5 to 10 minutes1. It is rapidly broken down by the MAO-B enzyme1.
• Methylene Blue's Effect on PEA: Methylene Blue (MB) can prolong the life of PEA in the body because MB acts as a reversible Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor (MAOI)23. Its ability to protect PEA from being broken down lasts as long as MB is present in significant amounts, diminishing as the body clears MB over a 12-to-24-hour period2. The finding that MB can inhibit the breakdown of amines like PEA is a well-established principle in pharmacology and is standard textbook knowledge3.
However, the premise that PEA is "ineffective unless taken with MB" is not supported by the sources. The sources describe PEA as a natural lipid mediator and an endogenous modulator for body balance4, with a broad spectrum of benefits due to its multifaceted mechanisms of action5. Its effectiveness in various applications is discussed independently of Methylene Blue:
• Established Effectiveness of PEA on its Own: PEA has strong evidence from multiple meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) supporting its use for chronic pain, leading to significant pain reduction and improved quality of life6. It is effective for nociceptive, neuropathic, and nociplastic pain6. This includes conditions like sciatic pain, carpal tunnel syndrome, painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), and post-herpetic neuralgia7.
• Moderate to Strong Evidence for Other Conditions: PEA also shows moderate to strong evidence as an adjunctive therapy for Glaucoma, reducing intraocular pressure and providing optic nerve neuroprotection8. It also has moderate to strong evidence for Osteoarthritis and Fibromyalgia, improving pain and disease severity9.
• Investigational Therapeutic Agent: Beyond these established uses, PEA is a largely investigational therapeutic agent for a wide range of conditions, including various neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Multiple Sclerosis, Frontotemporal Dementia, Traumatic Brain Injury, Stroke, Mild Cognitive Impairment, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Epilepsy, Neonatal Anoxia-Ischemia, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Myasthenia Gravis)6.... It is also being investigated for metabolic and organ health (NASH, CKD, Metabolic Syndrome, Atherosclerosis, IBS, Colitis, Diabetic Retinopathy, Vascular Injury)8..., and sensory/respiratory conditions (Sleep Disturbance, Depression, Anxiety Disorders, Schizophrenia, Tinnitus, Post-COVID-19 Olfactory Dysfunction, Influenza, Common Cold, COVID-19)17.... PEA's use in these contexts is discussed based on its own mechanisms, such as activating PPAR-α, modulating the endocannabinoid system, and influencing mast and glial cell activity5.
Combined Use of PEA and Methylene Blue
Crucially, a comprehensive review of the available research reveals a complete absence of any direct or indirect evidence, studies, or mentions concerning the combined use of Methylene Blue and Palmitoylethanolamide21.

Since our goal is to be able to get these into us, maybe you should point this out
You've raised a crucial point about the practical aspect of getting these substances "into us," as the method of delivery and how the body processes them significantly impacts their effectiveness and safety. This involves understanding their formulations, how they are administered, and the challenges associated with getting them to their intended targets.
Here's a breakdown of how Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) and Methylene Blue (MB) are administered, along with the key considerations for their delivery:
Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA): Oral Administration and Bioavailability
Palmitoylethanolamide is described as a natural lipid mediator found in the body and certain foods1. For human consumption, it has been available as a dietary supplement in the United States since 201523. This indicates that its primary route for being "gotten into us" is oral administration.
However, a critical point regarding PEA when taken on its own is its extremely short lifespan in the body4. Phenylethylamine (PEA), which the user referred to as "pea," has a very short half-life, estimated to be only about 5 to 10 minutes4. It is rapidly broken down by the MAO-B enzyme4.
Methylene Blue (MB): Diverse Administration Routes and Delivery Challenges
Methylene Blue is a synthetic dye with various applications, leading to multiple ways it can be "gotten into us"56. Its delivery methods are often tailored to its intended use, whether diagnostic, supportive, or investigational therapeutic:
• Oral Administration:
    ◦ MB is used as an oral rinse or mouthwash for the management of oral mucositis pain, a common side effect of cancer therapy7....
    ◦ Long-term oral exposure to MB has been studied in animal models, specifically in a 2-year oral carcinogenicity study in male rats, which unfortunately found an increased incidence of pancreatic islet adenomas or carcinomas in all dosed groups, raising a significant safety flag for chronic oral use15....
• Injections (Various Types):
    ◦ Intravenous (IV) injection is used for supportive care, such as for ifosfamide-induced encephalopathy in lymphoma patients, where it helps restore mitochondrial function in the brain7.... It has also been used in mouse studies to influence tumor oxygenation22....
    ◦ Local injections are common for diagnostic and surgical purposes, where MB acts as a dye:
        ▪ Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy (SLNB): MB is injected near the primary tumor (e.g., in breast cancer, melanoma, cervical cancer, endometrial cancer) to stain and identify draining lymph nodes for staging7....
        ▪ Intra-arterial injection into resected colorectal specimens helps pathologists harvest more lymph nodes for accurate staging7....
        ▪ Portal vein injection guides precise surgical removal of liver cancer (HCC) segments7....
        ▪ Intratumoral injection into lung tumors has been evaluated to study its spatial diffusion for potential gene therapy delivery45....
• Topical Application / Spraying:
    ◦ Used in chromoendoscopy, where a dilute solution is sprayed onto the lining of the esophagus or stomach to help visualize precancerous lesions (e.g., Barrett's esophagus, gastric intestinal metaplasia)7....
    ◦ Intraoperative spraying of MB during thyroidectomy is being investigated to help identify and preserve parathyroid glands and nerves, though not for direct cancer treatment57....
Key Challenges in Delivering MB as a Direct Cancer Therapeutic:
Despite MB's versatile administration routes for diagnostic and supportive uses, getting it effectively "into us" as a direct, curative anti-cancer therapy faces significant hurdles, particularly for solid tumors:
• Rapid Metabolism and Elimination: MB is rapidly metabolized and eliminated from the body6162. It can also be rapidly reduced in vivo to its colorless, photodynamically inactive "leuco" form, which is not therapeutically active63.
• Poor Tumor Localization and Retention: Systemically administered MB can exhibit poor localization and retention within tumor tissues63.
• Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB): While MB is known to cross the BBB6465, studies in glioblastoma models showed a complete lack of efficacy in vivo because it was difficult to achieve a sufficient and sustained therapeutic concentration within the brain tumor after systemic administration63.... This highlights that for CNS tumors, overcoming the drug delivery challenge is paramount6768.
• Limited Light Penetration for Photodynamic Therapy (PDT): PDT, which relies on light to activate MB, is limited to superficial cancers or lesions accessible by endoscopy due to the poor penetration depth of light through biological tissues10.... Also, the hypoxic core of many tumors can be resistant to PDT, as oxygen is needed to generate the cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS)7273.
Advancing MB Delivery: The Role of Nanotechnology
To overcome these significant pharmacokinetic and drug delivery challenges, especially for systemic therapeutic applications of MB, the most promising solution lies in nanotechnology7475.
• Nanocarriers, such as liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles, or gold nanoparticles, are being explored to encapsulate MB7475.
• These advanced formulations can improve MB's solubility, protect it from premature metabolism, and enhance its accumulation in tumor tissue through the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect63....
• For example, MB-loaded polymeric nanoparticles have demonstrated improved permeation of the BBB and enhanced drug accumulation in glioblastoma cells in preclinical models66.... Similarly, encapsulating MB in silica nanoparticles significantly enhanced its efficacy in killing osteosarcoma cells for PDT32....
Connecting PEA and MB: A Different Kind of Interaction
As we discussed, Phenylethylamine (PEA) has a very short half-life due to rapid breakdown by the MAO-B enzyme4. Methylene Blue can prolong the life of PEA in the body because MB acts as a reversible Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor (MAOI)8081. Its ability to protect PEA from being broken down lasts as long as MB is present in significant amounts80. This finding is a well-established principle in pharmacology and is standard textbook knowledge81.
However, it's crucial to reiterate that a comprehensive review of the available research reveals a complete absence of any direct or indirect evidence, studies, or mentions concerning the combined use of Methylene Blue and Palmitoylethanolamide for treating cancer or any other medical condition in the provided sources82.
Your perspective on the current regulatory framework, where raw herbs are often classified as dietary supplements and face different pathways for validation compared to nature-derived pharmaceuticals, directly impacts how these substances can be "gotten into us" and the level of scientific scrutiny applied to their therapeutic claims83.... This structural difference influences which compounds receive extensive funding for drug development and advanced delivery systems, often leaving substances solely classified as "supplements" in a different research and commercial landscape2....
