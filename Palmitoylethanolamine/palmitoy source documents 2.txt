•
Excerpts from "Jagger et.al 98 Pain & Inflammation_ Pain.pdf": This study found that PEA, like the cannabinoid ANA, could reduce pain in models of bladder inflammation and paw pain in rats. It suggests that because PEA primarily acts on peripheral CB2 receptors and not brain CB1 receptors, it might be possible to develop pain medications that don't have the mind-altering side effects associated with cannabinoids.
•
Excerpts from "Lav-NevritinaL-RP-7.pdf": This document explains that cannabinoids work by affecting specific receptors in the brain and immune system. It notes that many studies support their use for chronic pain, and that high levels of CB1 receptors in the spinal cord may explain their pain-reducing effects. Peripheral CB2 receptors are thought to be involved in treating inflammatory pain. However, it also cautions about potential short-term side effects like confusion, sleepiness, and gastrointestinal issues, and mentions that their use is heavily regulated.
•
Excerpts from "Psychiatry Clin Neurosci - 2022 - Abedini - Efficacy and safety of palmitoylethanolamide as an adjunctive treatment for.pdf": This source indicates that PEA levels increase in the body and brain during nerve injury and inflammation. It also mentions that a study found a link between reduced diversity of gut bacteria and increased PEA in feces, which could be a sign of an "unhealthy" gut microbiome and has been connected to mental health issues like psychosis and depression.
•
Excerpts from "S1043661814000656_TEXTextracted.txt": This review discusses endocannabinoid-related fat-based mediators, including PEA, which share similar metabolic processes with endocannabinoids. It explores their roles in normal bodily functions and in common neurological disorders.

•
Excerpts from "fnbeh-05-00057.pdf": This source suggests that cannabinoid signaling can reduce depression-like and anxiety-like behaviors in laboratory models. These effects are stronger in stressful situations, implying that medications that boost this signaling could be useful for emotional disorders.
•
Excerpts from "fnut-07-00017.pdf": This review explains that bioactive lipids, including PEA, are crucial for gut health and how the gut interacts with the brain (the gut-brain axis). These lipids, released "on demand," can have either pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory effects on the gut, immune system, and central nervous system, helping to regulate overall balance.
•
Excerpts from "fnut-07-00017.pdf": This document describes the endocannabinoid system (eCB) as a complex network of signaling molecules found in many body parts, including the brain, liver, and gut bacteria. Key eCB molecules, AEA and 2-AG, activate cannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2). CB1 receptors are mainly in the brain and nerves, affecting sensation, memory, and movement, while CB2 receptors are more in peripheral organs and immune cells.
•
Excerpts from "fnut-07-00017.pdf": This source suggests that targeting specific Specialized Pro-resolving Lipid Mediators (SPMs) and the endocannabinoid system (which includes PEA and OEA) could lead to new therapies. This would involve activating beneficial anti-inflammatory lipids or blocking their receptors and enzymes.
•
Excerpts from "laviolette-et-al-2017-palmitoylethanolamide-modulates-gpr55-receptor-signaling-in-the-ventral-hippocampus-to-regulate.pdf": This research investigated how PEA, by activating the GPR55 receptor in the ventral hippocampus (a brain region important for memory and emotions), affects the brain's dopamine system. They found that PEA led to increased dopamine activity and caused disruptions in social interaction, recognition memory, and fear memory. These effects were blocked by a GPR55 antagonist, suggesting a specific role for GPR55 signaling.
•
Excerpts from "pyu111.pdf": This document states that fat-based molecules like PEA and oleoylethanolamide (OEA) are natural substances in the body with many functions, and they are produced "on demand" when needed.
•
Excerpts from "rstb.2011_TEXTextracted.txt": This source considers the potential of natural fatty acid ethanolamides, such as PEA, to treat widespread inflammation or block inflammatory signals from the body's periphery (outside the brain) from reaching the brain.
•
Excerpts from "s12035-013-8487-6_TEXTextracted.txt": This document highlights that when PEA is given as a treatment, it has been effective in experimental models of both acute inflammation (like rapid, short-term swelling) and neurogenic inflammation (inflammation involving nerves) that are linked to mast cells. It also has brain-protective effects, such as in models of spinal cord injury, a type of nerve cell death caused by excessive stimulation, and against memory and learning problems induced by a specific amyloid beta protein in mice.
•
Excerpts from "s12035-015-9253-8_TEXTextracted.txt": This source suggests that preventing or slowing down the natural breakdown of PEA by targeting specific enzymes could be another way to treat brain inflammation (neuroinflammation).
•
Excerpts from "s40122-024-00685-4.pdf": This document reviews how PEA helps manage chronic nerve pain. It emphasizes PEA's anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving effects, particularly through its interaction with the endocannabinoid system and its ability to reduce brain inflammation. It notes that PEA's ability to protect mast cells and glial cells (support cells in the nervous system) is key for both pain relief and treating neurodegenerative diseases. The review also addresses challenges with PEA's absorption and discusses newer formulations designed to improve its effectiveness.
•

•
Excerpts from "1155270_TEXTextracted.txt": This introduction states that Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most common brain-wasting dementia, characterized by amyloid-beta buildup, neurofibrillary tangles, and brain inflammation. It suggests that abnormal activity of support cells in the brain (reactive gliosis) is key, and that early treatments combining brain protection with anti-inflammatory effects (like PEA) could be a good approach for AD. PEA is described as a natural molecule produced by these support cells, with known anti-inflammatory and brain-protective effects. The study aims to see if chronic PEA treatment can affect the development of AD in a special mouse model.
•
Excerpts from "1155270_TEXTextracted.txt": This source, along with, reports findings from quantitative Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) showing that PEA treatment altered metabolic markers in the brain regions (prefrontal cortex and hippocampus) of AD mice at different ages. These changes suggest PEA's influence on brain chemistry.
•

•
Excerpts from "1155275_TEXTextracted.txt": This document emphasizes that Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia in older people, where abnormal brain support cells (reactive gliosis) play a significant role. It suggests that using combined treatments that protect brain cells and reduce inflammation, like PEA, to restore the function of these support cells (astrocytes) could be a suitable approach for AD. PEA, a natural compound made by glial cells, has demonstrated anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects, and its ability to improve memory problems in AD rodent models has been shown.
•
Excerpts from "1155275_TEXTextracted.txt": This source concludes that its findings demonstrate how AD develops behaviorally and molecularly, and it highlights the therapeutic promise of ultra-micronized PEA (um-PEA) in managing the disease.
•
Excerpts from "1161_TEXTextracted.txt": This document explains that Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is characterized by visible brain shrinkage and microscopic signs like amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. It notes that newer biomarkers (tools to detect disease activity in living individuals) have led to updated understandings of AD, though its clinical progression remains unpredictable.
•
Excerpts from "1191_TEXTextracted.txt": This source explains that a large and varied group of diseases are characterized by problems in the brain's white matter, which are any disorders that weaken or change the myelin sheath. Myelin is the protective coating around nerve fibers in the brain, optic nerves, and spinal cord.
•
Excerpts from "1191_TEXTextracted.txt": This document explains that cognitive decline isn't just about grey matter; age-related changes in the brain's white matter (myelinated nerve fibers) also contribute. It notes that white matter volume decreases from around age 50, and myelin sheaths show signs of degeneration, including internal "balloons" or cavities that cause swelling.
•
Excerpts from "1191_TEXTextracted.txt": This source points out that while Alzheimer's disease was traditionally seen as a "grey matter" disease, advanced brain imaging now clearly shows damage to white matter. Post-mortem and in-vivo studies reveal reduced white matter volume, structural changes, and defects in the myelin's lipid layers.
•
Excerpts from "1429799897_SkaperetalCNSND-DT_NeuroinflammationNeurocognitiveDisorders(2014).pdf": This document highlights that inflammation is a key component in neurodegenerative diseases (like Alzheimer's) and certain mental health disorders (like anxiety/depression). It states that immune cells in the brain, such as microglia and mast cells, are crucial players in brain inflammation. When these cells are out of balance, it can affect cognitive performance, and PEA, a natural lipid, can help by modulating these cells, offering a new treatment strategy for cognitive decline.
•
Excerpts from "1429799897_SkaperetalCNSND-DT_NeuroinflammationNeurocognitiveDisorders(2014).pdf": This document explains that PEA is produced and broken down by microglia and mast cells, and it helps to control their activity. Studies in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) showed that PEA reduced memory problems and counteracted abnormal astrocyte activity caused by amyloid-beta. In a mouse model of Parkinson's disease, PEA reduced nerve cell loss and inflammation, and improved motor problems. This suggests PEA helps maintain balance in cells by resolving inflammation.
•
Excerpts from "1429799897_SkaperetalCNSND-DT_NeuroinflammationNeurocognitiveDisorders(2014).pdf": This source discusses how a combination of PEA and luteolin (a plant compound) in an ultra-micronized form was more effective than PEA alone in animal models. For instance, in a mouse model of anxiety/depression, this combination showed significant antidepressant effects and promoted brain cell growth and connections. In an ex-vivo (outside a living organism) Alzheimer's disease model, this combination normalized inflammation markers and prevented nerve cell death, whereas PEA or luteolin alone were ineffective.
•
Excerpts from "14399_TEXTextracted.txt": This document mentions transient global amnesia, a type of temporary memory loss that is less severe than typical dementias. It usually affects people aged 60 and over and resolves naturally within 12 to 24 hours.
•
Excerpts from "1601718_TEXTextracted.txt": This document states that effective drug treatments for dementia and Alzheimer's disease are still unclear. It highlights PEA as an important mediator with pain-relieving, anti-inflammatory, and brain-protective properties, acting on various targets in the central and peripheral nervous systems, as well as immune cells, with a good safety profile. The study mentioned here examines the behavioral effects of long-term PEA administration in Tg2576 mice, an Alzheimer's model.
•
Excerpts from "1669443_TEXTextracted.txt": This source confirms that long-term use of PEA helps to prevent cognitive decline in Tg2576 mice, which are a common animal model for Alzheimer's disease.
•
Excerpts from "1742-2094-9-49.pdf": This study showed that PEA can prevent brain support cells (astrocytes) from over-multiplying and reduces nerve cell death in lab cultures exposed to amyloid-beta (Aβ), a protein involved in Alzheimer's. It supports the idea that an imbalance of Aβ in the brain is a starting point for AD, leading to damage of nerve connections and nerve cell death.
•
Excerpts from "1871527313666140806124322_TEXTextracted.txt": This source identifies Alzheimer’s disease as the most common neurodegenerative disorder, with amyloid-beta fibril deposits (senile plaques) as a key pathological feature. It suggests that brain inflammation plays a significant role in the harmful effects of amyloid-beta in AD.
•
Excerpts from "2020.JAD.uncorrected+proofs.pdf": This document describes a study investigating the effects of PEA combined with luteolin (PEA-LUT) on behavior, cognitive function, and brain activity in patients with Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD). It specifies that patients underwent cognitive and neurophysiological tests before and after four weeks of PEA-LUT treatment at a dose of 700 mg twice daily.
•
Excerpts from "2403493_TEXTextracted.txt": This source notes that PEA has different protective effects against damage caused by amyloid-beta (Aβ42) in lab-grown nerve cells and astrocytes from different types of mice. Specifically, PEA showed protective effects in normal mouse nerve cells but not in nerve cells from AD mice that produced too much Aβ.
•
Excerpts from "2584_TEXTextracted.txt": This review explains that cognitive dysfunction syndrome in dogs and cats is a common neurodegenerative disorder in older animals, serving as a natural model for human Alzheimer's disease. It highlights that brain inflammation can contribute to nerve cell degeneration. The document discusses the potential benefits of PEA as a dietary intervention to rebalance this inflammation and protect brain cells. PEA can work directly by activating specific receptors (GPR55 and PPAR-α), which can reduce signs of age-related cognitive problems. It can also indirectly boost the effects of other natural endocannabinoids, improving memory processes.
•
Excerpts from "2584_TEXTextracted.txt": This source states that age-related cognitive decline in pets, particularly Canine Cognitive Dysfunction Syndrome (CCDS), is a significant area of interest due to its strong similarities with human Alzheimer's disease. CCDS is broadly defined and includes conditions like hyperaggressiveness, confusional syndrome, involutive depression, and dysthymia in older dogs.
•
Excerpts from "2584_TEXTextracted.txt": This document clarifies that a definitive diagnosis of Cognitive Dysfunction Syndrome (CDS) in pets can only be made after death, through microscopic examination of the brain. A presumptive diagnosis relies on the pet's medical history and observable behavioral signs, and it's crucial to rule out other medical conditions that might mimic CDS. Several questionnaires have been developed to aid in CDS diagnosis.
•
Excerpts from "2584_TEXTextracted.txt": This source indicates that mild cognitive impairment (MCI) was found in 13% to 28% of dogs aged 8–12 years, and in an even higher percentage (41% to 68%) of dogs 13 years and older. This was based on a diagnostic classification system that considers clinical signs across different categories.
•
Excerpts from "293_TEXTextracted.txt": This document defines Subjective Cognitive Impairment (SCI), also known as "brain fog," as a self-reported decline in cognitive abilities (like concentration or problem-solving) compared to prior functioning, without strict diagnostic cutoffs. It suggests that PEA and luteolin are promising agents for combating brain inflammation. An exploratory comparison within the study showed similar cognitive improvements whether patients received PEA alone or PEA with corticosteroids, which supports the idea that long-term COVID-19 neurological issues might be linked to inflammation, and that modulating this inflammation is important.
•
Excerpts from "297_TEXTextracted.txt": This document states that Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) typically impairs brain functions such as executive actions, cognitive abilities, memory processing, and language. Animal models are used to study TBI and find new treatments. Historically, TBI treatment focused mainly on protecting neurons, but recent literature emphasizes the importance of also considering damage to blood vessel lining (endothelial cells) and other precursor cells.
•
Excerpts from "4845_TEXTextracted.txt": This study reports that a modified form of PEA, N-Palmitoylethanolamide-Oxazoline (PEA-OXA), protects against brain injury (middle cerebral artery occlusion, MCAo) in diabetic rats by affecting a specific pathway (SIRT1). It notes that many brain-protective and anti-inflammatory compounds haven't been very successful in stroke models, possibly because they only protect nerve cells and don't shield brain blood vessels from inflammation and harmful reactive molecules.
•
Excerpts from "4845_TEXTextracted.txt": This document shows that histological analysis (studying tissue under a microscope) revealed PEA-OXA significantly improved neurological injuries caused by MCAo compared to regular PEA at the same dose. It also noted an effect on mast cell degranulation (release of substances from mast cells) in the injured tissue.
•
Excerpts from "509_TEXTextracted.txt": This document describes acute ischemic stroke (AIS) as a major cause of brain damage due to reduced blood supply and a prolonged inflammatory process. It introduces co-ultramicronized PEA and luteolin (PEALut) as a promising nutritional strategy to resolve brain inflammation occurring in AIS, suggesting it can help counteract the inflammatory processes that worsen brain damage after a stroke.
•
Excerpts from "509_TEXTextracted.txt": This source reports that PEALut has shown brain-protective effects in animal stroke models and has improved neurological status, spasticity (muscle stiffness), cognitive abilities, pain, and independence in daily activities in 250 human stroke patients after just 30 days of treatment. It also notes that cognitive impairment affects over 40% of stroke survivors, with most cognitive improvements occurring within the first three months after a stroke.
•
Excerpts from "667_TEXTextracted.txt": This document serves as a review of PEA's effects on neurodegenerative diseases, covering both animal and human studies. It highlights PEA's brain-protective, anti-inflammatory, and pain-relieving functions.
•
Excerpts from "8052642_TEXTextracted.txt": This document explains that Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) is a complex disorder mainly affecting the frontal and/or temporal lobes of the brain. It manifests as problems with executive functions (like planning), language difficulties, or changes in behavior and personality.
•
Excerpts from "8052642_TEXTextracted.txt": This study concludes that PEA treatment for FTD is safe and may help slow down the progression of the disease, functional decline, and language deterioration. It calls for further multi-center studies to confirm its effectiveness and better understand how it works.
•
Excerpts from "British J Pharmacology - 2016 - Petrosino - The pharmacology of palmitoylethanolamide and first data on the therapeutic.pdf": This section discusses how neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, multiple sclerosis (MS), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are characterized by the gradual and selective death of nerve cells. This cell death leads to a progressive loss of nervous system functions, resulting in cognitive problems, dementia, behavioral issues, motor abnormalities, or paralysis.
•
Excerpts from "Dialnet-SystematicReviewOfNeuroprotectiveActionsOfTheECPIn-10142941.pdf": This is a systematic review that aims to analyze how PEA protects against nerve cell damage and inflammation in a specific mouse brain cell line (HT-22 hippocampal neurons) subjected to oxygen deprivation and reoxygenation. The goal is to apply these findings to patients with neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. The review suggests that PEA, especially with antioxidant supplements, provides significant brain protection, influences immune signaling, and reduces acetylcholine levels. It concludes that PEA contributes to preventing cognitive neurological damage, including memory preservation.
•
Excerpts from "Dialnet-SystematicReviewOfNeuroprotectiveActionsOfTheECPIn-10142941.pdf": This document reports that among the human studies reviewed, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases were each studied in two investigations, while Frontotemporal Dementia and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis were each explored in one study.
•
Excerpts from "JAD-143039_TEXTextracted.txt": This study investigates the different effects of PEA against amyloid-beta-induced toxicity in lab-grown brain cells (cortical neurons and astrocytes) from both normal and Alzheimer's disease model mice. It proposes that a treatment approach focusing on both brain protection and reducing brain inflammation could be effective for Alzheimer's disease, given its varied pathological changes.
•
Excerpts from "JAD-170699_TEXTextracted.txt": This research shows that PEA can reduce the activation of astrocytes (brain support cells) caused by amyloid-beta (Aβ42) and improve the survival of nerve cells in lab-grown co-cultures of astrocytes and neurons. It suggests that astrocyte problems might contribute to brain inflammation and neurodegeneration.
•
Excerpts from "JAD-200426_TEXTextracted.txt": This document describes a study (also referenced in) that explores the effects of PEA combined with luteolin (PEA-LUT) on behavior and brain activity in patients diagnosed with Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD).
•
Excerpts from "JAD143039.pdf": This document states that Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology is marked by extracellular amyloid plaques (surrounded by activated microglia, reactive astrocytes, and degenerating neurons) and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (caused by abnormal tau protein).
•
Excerpts from "S0022093022020132_TEXTextracted.txt": This source mentions PEA and other endocannabinoids in the context of a lithium-pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy, as well as the destruction of nerve tissue in the hippocampus and the abnormal sprouting of mossy fibers.
•
Excerpts from "S0889159112002048_TEXTextracted.txt": This document highlights that Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a major cause of death and disability worldwide. It explains that the initial mechanical injury to the brain leads to problems with the blood-brain barrier, swelling in the brain, and increased pressure inside the skull. The subsequent "secondary injury" involves an inflammatory response and the release of harmful substances (cytokines), leading to further nerve cell death. This study shows that PEA helps protect the brain's blood vessels and reduces this secondary injury after TBI in mice.
•
Excerpts from "biof_TEXTextracted.txt": This review explains that brain inflammation leads to brain degeneration, cognitive problems, and neurodegenerative disorders. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can activate brain support cells (glial cells) and immune cells, causing them to release inflammatory substances. Luteolin, a plant compound, is reviewed for its brain-protective effects in TBI and neurodegenerative disorders, particularly by suppressing immune cell activation (like mast cells) and inflammatory mediators.
•
Excerpts from "biomolecules-11-00600-v2.pdf": This document notes that existing treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD) are not cures, and many clinical trials have failed, prompting a search for new approaches like targeting astrocytes (brain support cells). It suggests that PEA's unique ability to modulate astrocytes based on their state makes it a potential therapeutic agent that could modify the disease's course in AD. It also mentions that neurofibrillary tangles, made of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins, cause changes in nerve cell structure.
•
Excerpts from "brainsci-14-00293-v2.pdf": This source reports on an exploratory study showing that patients who had neurological symptoms after COVID-19 and were treated with co-ultraPEALut (PEA combined with luteolin) experienced objective and subjective improvements in cognitive function, with statistically significant improvements in memory and general cognitive assessments. Control patients also improved, but less noticeably.
•
Excerpts from "brainsci-14-00293-v2.pdf": This document concludes that co-ultraPEALut is beneficial for subjective cognitive impairment (brain fog) following SARS-CoV-2 infection. This supports the idea that brain inflammation might be a key cause of "long COVID" neurological issues, and highlights the importance of treatments that manage this inflammation.
•
Excerpts from "cddis2014376_TEXTextracted.txt": This document states that Alzheimer's disease is characterized by progressive dementia, affecting memory and other cognitive skills. It emphasizes that beyond plaques and tangles, amyloid-beta fragments trigger a strong brain inflammatory response, producing various inflammatory substances.
•
Excerpts from "fpsyt-13-1038122.pdf": This is a systematic review examining the therapeutic effects of PEA in cognitive decline. Its goal is to clarify PEA's role in neurocognitive disorders (NCDs) and cognitive decline by synthesizing all available clinical and preclinical data. The review suggests that PEA could be a valuable treatment option to prevent neurodegeneration and support the body's natural repair processes against disease progression.
•
