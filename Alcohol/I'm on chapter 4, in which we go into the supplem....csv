Herb / Compound,Summary of Proposed Mechanism & Effects,Number of Sources Cited,Total Mentions
Kudzu,May alter alcohol metabolism (ALDH2 inhibition) leading to mild aversive effects; potential to reduce cravings and overall consumption.,7,33
Naltrexone,Mu-opioid receptor antagonist; blocks alcohol's rewarding effects to reduce cravings and relapse to heavy drinking.,4,13
Ashwagandha,Adaptogen that modulates the HPA axis (stress response) and GABA systems; proposed to reduce stress- and anxiety-driven drinking.,4,22
Passionflower,"Modulates the GABA system to produce anxiolytic (anti-anxiety) effects, potentially reducing the urge to self-medicate with alcohol. ",4,22
St. John's Wort,Primarily an antidepressant (may elevate serotonin); can indirectly reduce drinking in those with co-occurring depression.,4,17
Milk Thistle,Primarily hepatoprotective (liver-protective); no direct evidence for reducing alcohol urge.,4,13
Disulfiram,"Aversive agent; inhibits aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), causing unpleasant symptoms if alcohol is consumed. ",3,7
Oxytocin,Neuropeptide involved in social bonding and stress modulation; being investigated for reducing stress- and cue-induced craving.,3,7
Apremilast,"PDE4 inhibitor with anti-inflammatory properties; preclinical evidence shows it reduces alcohol intake, possibly via amygdala GABA modulation. ",3,13
LY2444296,Kappa Opioid Receptor (KOP) antagonist; preclinical data shows it reduces alcohol self-administration in dependent models by targeting withdrawal-related negative affect.,3,12
Psilocybin,Serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonist; early clinical results suggest a potential signal for craving reduction when combined with psychotherapy.,2,11
Acamprosate,Glutamate modulator; restores balance to neurotransmitter systems to support abstinence.,2,12
Topiramate,"Anticonvulsant (GABA enhancement, glutamate antagonism); off-label use shows it reduces heavy drinking days and overall consumption. ",2,8
Baclofen,GABAB receptor agonist with anxiolytic properties; evidence for reducing drinking is limited/low.,2,8
Ondansetron,"Serotonin 5-HT3 antagonist; may reduce alcohol's rewarding effects, particularly in specific patient subpopulations. ",2,8
Gabapentin,"GABA analogue; may reduce drinking in patients with significant withdrawal symptoms, but evidence is mixed. ",2,7
Prickly Pear Cactus,"Proposed to reduce the inflammatory response to alcohol, thereby lessening hangover symptoms. No evidence for reducing urge. ",2,3
PPL-138,Nociceptin Receptor (NOP) agonist; preclinical data suggests it may treat co-occurring PTSD and AUD by reducing anxiety and alcohol intake.,1,10
