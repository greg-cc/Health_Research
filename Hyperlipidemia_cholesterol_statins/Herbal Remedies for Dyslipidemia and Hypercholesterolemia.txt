Herbs Showing a Very Strong Effect
• Salvia miltiorrhiza (Danshen)
    ◦ Reported Effects: A meta-analysis demonstrated that Danshen injections could effectively and significantly reduce serum levels of triglycerides (p < 0.001 for all), total cholesterol (p < 0.001 for all), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p < 0.001 for all), while also elevating high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (p ≤ 0.02 for all) in the overall population. The lipid-lowering effect of Danshen injection was robust in patients with heart disease or stroke, and it exhibited a dose- and time-dependent relationship, with lipid reduction in high-dose treatment groups (30 mL) being greater than in low-dose groups (20 mL), and the reduction magnitude increasing with treatment prolongation.
